the best neighborhood

this project is concerned with comparing finding the best neighborhood in any city of choice and classifying the neighborhood to 4 classes based on the ammount of unique venues that exist in it

the segmentation of any city will be very useful to people who are trying to open a new business and targeting a specific class or need a recommendation to the location of opening the business



the segmentation will be based on the amount of unique services and venues that the neighborhood offers each class will have a close amount of unique venues marking them as low, medium, high, and best 

as it stands the higher the amount of unique venues the better the neighborhood because as the place contain more different venues it will attract more different people which makes it a better place for opening a business
